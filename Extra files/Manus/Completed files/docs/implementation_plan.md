# Affiliate Matrix - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the approach for enhancing the Affiliate Matrix project based on the APEX MASTER PROMPT v2.3. The plan is structured to enable parallel execution streams where possible, focusing on two key vertical slices (Program Listing/View and Connection Management) while also providing containerization, configuration, and enhanced developer experience features.

## Credit Budget
- Total budget: 4216 credits
- Warning thresholds: 3162 credits (75%) and 3794 credits (90%)

## Parallel Execution Streams

### Stream 1: Backend Implementation
- **Stage 1: Backend Program Service & Router Logic** (Est. 1000 credits)
- **Stage 3: Backend Connection Service & Router Logic** (Est. 900 credits)

### Stream 2: Frontend & Stubs
- **Stage 2: Frontend Program Listing UI** (Est. 1000 credits)
- **Stage 5: Foundational Stubs, Containerization & DX** (Est. 700 credits)

### Sequential Stage (After Implementation)
- **Stage 4: Testing Implementation** (Est. 600 credits)

## Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Stream 1: Backend Implementation

#### Stage 1: Backend Program Service & Router Logic
1. Create backend/services directory if not exists
2. Implement program_service.py with Service Class pattern
   - Implement get_programs_list logic with pagination, sorting, and filtering
   - Implement get_program_by_id with proper error handling
   - Add logging and telemetry hooks
   - Include comments for future extensions
3. Update backend/routers/programs.py
   - Inject service via Depends
   - Call service methods
   - Ensure response_model usage
   - Add logging points

#### Stage 3: Backend Connection Service & Router Logic
1. Implement connection_service.py with Service Class pattern
   - Implement CRUD logic
   - Implement test_connection_logic and trigger_sync_logic
   - Add error handling
   - Include comments for future extensions
2. Update backend/routers/connections.py
   - Inject service
   - Call service methods
   - Handle async 202 Accepted responses
   - Add logging points
   - Include Vault client initialization stub

### Stream 2: Frontend & Stubs

#### Stage 2: Frontend Program Listing UI
1. Create reusable components
   - Implement DataTable.vue
   - Implement BaseCard.vue
2. Implement views
   - Create ProgramIndexView.vue
   - Create ProgramDetailView.vue skeleton
3. Update programsStore if needed
4. Add telemetry hooks and feature flag comments

#### Stage 5: Foundational Stubs, Containerization & DX
1. Containerization
   - Create backend/Dockerfile
   - Create frontend/Dockerfile
   - Create docker-compose.yml
2. Configuration
   - Create backend/config.py
   - Create backend/.env.example
3. Future-Proofing Stubs
   - Add DeltaChange<T> TS Interface/JSON Schema
   - Add FeatureFlagConfig schema
   - Create feature flag middleware
   - Update OpenAPI spec
   - Add skeleton routes/service methods for delta endpoints
4. DX Enhancements
   - Create custom exception classes
   - Create FastAPI exception handler
   - Create GraphView.vue skeleton
   - Create implementation notes documentation

### Sequential Stage: Testing Implementation
1. Backend Tests
   - Create tests for program router and service
   - Create tests for connection router and service
2. Frontend Tests
   - Create tests for ProgramIndexView.vue
   - Create tests for DataTable.vue

## Dependencies and Execution Order

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Update data structures and API contracts (if needed)

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Stream 1: Backend Implementation
     - Stage 1: Program Service & Router
     - Stage 3: Connection Service & Router
   - Stream 2: Frontend & Stubs
     - Stage 2: Frontend Program Listing UI
     - Stage 5: Foundational Stubs & DX

3. **Final Stage**
   - Stage 4: Testing Implementation
   - Integration and verification

## Credit Monitoring
- Track credit usage throughout implementation
- Provide warnings at 75% and 90% thresholds
- Prioritize core functionality if credit limit is approached
