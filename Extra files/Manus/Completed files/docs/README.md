# Affiliate Matrix Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Affiliate Matrix is a comprehensive automated affiliate marketing system designed to streamline the discovery, management, and optimization of affiliate programs. The system consists of a backend API built with Python FastAPI and a frontend application built with Vue.js.

This document provides an overview of the project structure, components, and integration points.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Contracts

The project defines clear data contracts using TypeScript interfaces and JSON Schema definitions. These contracts ensure consistency between frontend and backend components.

**Key Files:**
- `/contracts/typescript/interfaces.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- `/contracts/json_schema/schemas.json`: JSON Schema definitions for data validation
- `/contracts/api/openapi.yaml`: OpenAPI v3 specification for the API

### 2. Backend API

The backend is built with Python FastAPI and provides RESTful endpoints for all system functionality.

**Key Files:**
- `/backend/app.py`: Main application entry point
- `/backend/models/models.py`: Pydantic models for data validation
- `/backend/routers/*.py`: API route handlers for different modules

**API Modules:**
- Programs: Manage affiliate programs
- Connections: Manage external API connections
- Discovery: Automate affiliate program discovery
- System: Monitor system performance and logs
- Budgets: Manage marketing budgets
- Automation: Configure automated tasks
- Settings: Manage user settings

### 3. Frontend Services

The frontend is built with Vue.js 3 using the Composition API and Pinia for state management.

**Key Files:**
- `/frontend/composables/*.ts`: Reusable composition functions for API interaction
- `/frontend/stores/*.ts`: Pinia stores for state management

**Frontend Modules:**
- Programs: Interface for managing affiliate programs
- Connections: Interface for managing external connections
- Discovery: Interface for automated program discovery
- System: Interface for system monitoring
- Budgets: Interface for budget management
- Automation: Interface for configuring automated tasks
- Settings: Interface for user settings

### 4. Testing

The project includes comprehensive test cases for both backend and frontend components.

**Key Files:**
- `/tests/backend/*.py`: Backend API test cases
- `/tests/frontend/*.spec.ts`: Frontend composables and stores test cases

### 5. Integration Documentation

The project includes detailed documentation on how frontend and backend components integrate.

**Key Files:**
- `/docs/integration/integration_blueprint.md`: Comprehensive integration guide
- `/docs/integration/data_flow_diagram.md`: Visual representation of data flow

## Development Workflow

1. **Backend Development:**
   - Implement route handlers in `/backend/routers/`
   - Define data models in `/backend/models/`
   - Implement business logic in `/backend/services/`

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Implement API interactions using composables in `/frontend/composables/`
   - Manage state using Pinia stores in `/frontend/stores/`
   - Create UI components in `/frontend/components/`
   - Assemble views in `/frontend/views/`

3. **Testing:**
   - Run backend tests with pytest
   - Run frontend tests with Jest

## Next Steps

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with:
- Comprehensive data contracts
- API endpoint skeletons
- Frontend service skeletons
- Test cases
- Integration documentation

To complete the application, the following steps are recommended:

1. Implement the business logic in backend services
2. Create UI components and views in the frontend
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Set up deployment pipelines
5. Conduct end-to-end testing

## Conclusion

The Affiliate Matrix project provides a robust foundation for building a comprehensive affiliate marketing automation system. The clear separation of concerns, well-defined contracts, and thorough documentation ensure that development can proceed efficiently and collaboratively.
